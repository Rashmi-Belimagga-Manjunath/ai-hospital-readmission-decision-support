AI-based decision-support system for hospital readmission risk

## AI-Based Hospital Readmission Prediction (Decision-Support System)

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can be applied as a **decision-support tool** to improve healthcare operational efficiency, with a focus on hospital readmission risk.

### Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of patient readmission following discharge, enabling healthcare teams to prioritise follow-up care and allocate resources more effectively. The project is framed within the Irish healthcare context, where data privacy, governance, and trust are critical considerations.

Due to GDPR and the limited availability of publicly accessible patient-level healthcare data in Ireland, a well-established public hospital dataset was used to demonstrate the AI methodology while maintaining a strong focus on ethical and operational constraints.

### Key Features
- Predictive modelling for hospital readmission risk
- Interpretable AI using Logistic Regression
- Feature importance and explainability analysis
- Decision-support framing (not automation)
- Ethical, governance, and GDPR-aware design

### Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- Logistic Regression
- Data preprocessing & evaluation techniques

### Dataset
- Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset (1999–2008)

### Disclaimer
This project is for academic and demonstrative purposes only and does not represent a deployable clinical system.
